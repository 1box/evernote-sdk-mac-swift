Evernote SDK for iOS/Mac version 1.2.1
=========================================

What this is
------------
This is a swift version fork for [evernote/evernote-sdk-mac](https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-mac).

Since evernote-sdk-mac for Mac OS is still OC version and cannot mix and match with Swift project, so I give a swift fork for my mac app.

Additional Features
---------------
1. `Define modules` in `Build Settings` set to YES
2. revert mac sdk product name from `EvernoteSDK-Mac` to `EvernoteSDKMac` since `-` cannot appear in umbrella file name
2. add a umbrella file named `EvernoteSDKMac.h`
4. import some header in umbrella file
